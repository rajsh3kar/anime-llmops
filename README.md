The anime-llmops project is a modern, modular application designed for building and operating large language model (LLM) pipelines specifically in the anime domain. Its primary goal is to enable users to ask questions about anime and receive intelligent recommendations powered by LLM technology.

Key Features and Architecture:

Streamlit Frontend: The project provides an interactive web application using Streamlit, allowing users to type anime-related questions and receive automatic recommendations.

Modular Pipeline: The core engine (AnimeRecommenderPipeline) integrates a vector store (for fast retrieval), custom prompt templates, and an LLM-based question-answering system.

Retrieval-Augmented Generation: Uses a retrieval step via a vector database (Chroma DB) to find relevant data and then leverages a large language model (such as those connected via Langchain + Groq or HuggingFace) for generating answers and recommendations.

Dockerized Deployment: The Dockerfile enables reproducible builds and containerized deployment, exposing Streamlit on port 8501.

Extensible Structure: Includes separate folders for configs, data handling, logging, utilities, and continuous development of analytics or other MLOps features.

Dependencies: Built primarily with Python, using libraries like Langchain, ChromaDB, Streamlit, HuggingFace sentence-transformers, and environment management via dotenv.

Typical Use Case:

A user enters an anime-related question in the Streamlit web UI.

The system retrieves relevant context from its vector database.

The pipeline constructs a prompt, queries an LLM, and returns curated anime recommendations or answers to the user.

This project is aimed at advancing the operationalization of LLMs (LLMOps) for specialized domains, demonstrating how retrieval-augmented LLM pipelines can be implemented for real-world recommendation systems, especially in the anime space.
